# Infinite (Music Player)
Infinite is a Music Player which is quite similar to iTunes, in this you can learn three most important things: 1.To Add Lottie animation, 2.To use card slider frame work and 3. The music player :). Right now this project is very basic I will  make changes in future updates and add API such that you can search music whichever you want..
